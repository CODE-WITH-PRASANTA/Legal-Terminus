              In an LLP, partners get limited liability protection. If the business
              faces loss or insolvency, partners are liable only up to their capital
              contribution. Also, one partner is not responsible for another
              partner’s negligence or misconduct.

              An LLP is managed through an LLP Agreement, which defines partners’
              roles, rights, and responsibilities. Day-to-day operations are
              usually handled by Designated Partners, making management smooth
              and well-structured.

              An LLP has its own legal identity separate from its partners. It can
              own property, sign contracts, borrow funds, and take legal action
              in the LLP’s name, even if partners change over time.

              LLPs have fewer compliances than Private Limited Companies. Audit
              is not mandatory unless turnover or contribution crosses a certain

              structure.
