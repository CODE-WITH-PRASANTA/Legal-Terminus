        Private limited company registration in India provides limited
        liability, legal independence, and access to tax benefits. Governed
        by the Companies Act, 2013, it requires a DSC, DIN, and documents
        like ID and address proof. The SPICe+ form enables combined
        application for name approval, incorporation, PAN, TAN, and GST.
        Once approved by the RoC, you receive a Certificate of
        Incorporation, allowing the company to operate legally, own assets,
        and sign contracts. Compliance tasks like annual returns and
        financial reporting are mandatory post-registration.
