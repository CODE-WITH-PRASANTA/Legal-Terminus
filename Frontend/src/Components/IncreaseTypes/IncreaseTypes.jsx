              This is the most common type of Private Limited Company. The liability of shareholders is limited to the unpaid amount on their shares. It is ideal for startups and growing businesses looking to raise funds while protecting personal assets.

              In this type, members agree to contribute a fixed amount in case of liquidation. It is generally suitable for non-profit or charitable organizations that do not require share capital.

              An unlimited company does not place any limit on members’ liability. Members are personally responsible for company debts. This structure is less common and is usually chosen by closely held businesses with full control over operations.
