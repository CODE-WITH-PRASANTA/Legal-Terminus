          Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a pivotal role in
          India’s economic growth. They employ over 11 crore (110 million)
          people, contribute approximately 29% to the country’s GDP, and
          account for nearly 50% of India’s total exports. Supporting MSMEs,
          therefore, is not merely about fostering a business category — it
          is about strengthening the backbone of the Indian economy and
          ensuring its continued vitality.

          What is Udyam Registration?
        </h3>

        <p className="udyam-intro-text">
          Udyam Registration (also known as MSME registration) is an initiative
          by the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MoMSME)
          designed to facilitate the online registration and certification of
          MSMEs. The program aims to simplify the registration process, making
          it easier for enterprises to gain official recognition and access
          to a range of government schemes, incentives, and support services.
